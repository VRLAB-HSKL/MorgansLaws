# Morgans Laws ðŸ’»

## About the project and our motivation
Aim of the project is teaching the player boolean algebra. To accomplish this the player has to master several stages in a virtual world. In the stages the player has to decide which logical gates should be used to complete a circuit. A connected circuit will open a door to the next stage. Stages get harder and contain a bigger variety of logical gates as the player passes through the game.

By allowing the player to touch the logical gates we hope to improve the understanding of how these gates work exactly. On and off states of the gates are visualized and should help the player to get an idea how different gates affect a circuit. To enable the player to transfer the newly learned concepts into the real world the logical gates are modeled after the ANSI/IEEE Std 91/91a-1991 standard [[1]](#references). Therefore a player should also be able to read and understand real circuit diagrams after playing Morgans Laws.

# Scenes
## Structure
Each set of stages is built within a scene. Additionally there's the Debug scene to help out developers to try out different elements and settings.

## PlayDemo

<p align="center">
    <img alt="PlayDemo" width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Scenes/PlayDemo.png">
</p>

#### Description
The Play Demo Scene for Morgans Laws contains 4 demo stages showing the various gameplay elements. The player first discovers two controllers explaining the controls. He can already try out grabbing and moving the controllers as he likes. Then he finds on his right side a socket. An And gate lies on the floor indicating he can pick it up and use the gate on the socket. After he is done, the doors open leading to the next stage.

## Debug

<p align="center">
    <img alt="Debug" width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Scenes/Debug.png">
</p>

#### Description
The Debug scene is for the developers and is used to test out single elements or complex circuits during development. Here you can test things out, like new scripts or different sets of component properties.

# Prefabs

<p align="center">
   <img alt="Walls" width="320" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Prefabs/Walls.png">
</p>

The restrictions of a stage. They contain an outer and inner element, each with its own material. This way, the glowing, transparency and color of each wall can be modified.

# Add new Stages

## 1. Setting up the Scene

<p align="center">
    <img alt="PlayDemoFull" width="700" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/PlayDemoFull.png">
</p>

Each scene contains a set of interconnected stages. The lighting, world floor (infinite floor), the player and the interaction mode manager are placed on the root. 

## 2. Setting up the Stage

<p align="center">
    <img alt="StageControl" width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/StageControl.png">
</p>

Each stage have to contain at least the following elements:

* a floor
* a door
* at least one power unit
* at least one cable connected to the power unit
* a stage window (Menu)

After you added all these elements to your new stage, proceed to configure its important elements.

## 3. Add Sockets and Gates

<p align="center">
    <img alt="SocketsGatesPower" width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/SocketsGatesPower.png">
</p>

Place your gates, sockets and power unit on your stage. Preferably put a `Gate` on a `Table`, so the player can easily grab the gate.

## 4. Setting up the Stage Window

After adding the stage window deactivate the canvas component to make it invisible, until the player enters your new stage. If your stage is the first stage of the scene, keep it activated.

### i. Resetting the cubes

<p align="center">
    <img alt="GatesControl" width="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/GatesControl.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="ResetScript" width="400" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/ResetScript.png">
</p>

To make it possible for the player to reset the logic gates in the stage, you have to group the gates in a new empty GameObject. Then add the Reset script to the new GameObject.

#### ii. Reference the New Group to the Reset Button

<p align="center">
    <img alt="ResetButton" width="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/ResetButton.png">
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="ResetClick" width="400" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/ResetClick.png">
</p>

Select the reset button in the stage window and add the method `ResetStage.ResetPositions` as the `On Click ()` method.

## 5. Setting up the floor

<p align="center">
    <img alt="FloorProperties" width="490" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/FloorProperties.png">
</p>

Select the floor and select your stage window as `Window` and your door as `Door`. Make sure you select the canvas of your stage window and the door element, that contains the Door script as component.

## 6. Add and Connect new Cables

<p align="center">
    <img alt="CablePlacement" width="320" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/CablePlacement.png">
</p>

Place a new `Cable` into your stage for each connection you want to add. Each Sable has a `Female` (start point / input) and `Male` (end point / output) connector. Place these connectors around the fitting connector of your power units, sockets or door.

## 7. Add Walls

<p align="center">
    <img alt="WallsPlacement" width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/main/documentation/Developers%20Guide/WallsPlacement.png">
</p>

Now You can add walls or other objects you want to add to your stage.

## 8. Test your stage

Your stage is now ready to get tested by you. If you want to know more about the Prefabs and their properties see the [Prefabs page](https://github.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/wiki/Prefabs). For best practices have a look at the [PlayDemo](https://github.com/VRLAB-HSKL/AVR21-3/wiki/Scenes#playdemo) scene in the assets/scene directory.
