# Morgans Laws ðŸ’»

Aim of the project is teaching the player boolean algebra. To accomplish this the player has to master several stages in a virtual world. In the stages the player has to decide which logical gates should be used to complete a circuit. A connected circuit will open a door to the next stage. Stages get harder and contain a bigger variety of logical gates as the player passes through the game.
